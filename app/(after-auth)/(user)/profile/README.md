2. **Coupon Application**: User can optionally enter a coupon code for discounts
3. **Payment Summary**: System shows final price and plan expiration date
4. **Payment Processing**: TossPayments SDK handles the payment flow
5. **Confirmation**: Payment is confirmed via API and subscription is created

## Test Coupons

For testing purposes, the following coupons are available:

- **TEST20**: 20% discount on any plan
- **SAVE5000**: â‚©5,000 flat discount

## Configuration

### TossPayments Setup

Update the following constants in `plans-client.tsx`:

```typescript
const TOSS_CLIENT_KEY = "your_actual_client_key";
```

And in `app/api/payments/confirm/route.ts`:

```typescript
const TOSS_SECRET_KEY = "your_actual_secret_key";
```

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in your `.env` file:

```env
TOSS_CLIENT_KEY=test_gck_docs_Ovk5rk1EwkEbP0W43n07xlzm
TOSS_SECRET_KEY=test_gsk_docs_OaPz8L5KdmQXkzRz3y47BMw6
```

## Database Schema

The system uses the following models:

- **Plan**: Subscription plans with flexible pricing and duration
- **DiscountCoupon**: Coupon codes with percentage or flat discounts
- **Payment**: Payment records from TossPayments
- **UserSubscription**: User subscription status and expiration

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/payments/confirm`: Confirms payment with TossPayments and creates subscription

## Color Scheme

Following the project's design system:

- **Primary**: Amber (amber-500, amber-600)
- **Secondary**: Gray shades
- **Success**: Green (green-50, green-600, green-800)
- **Error**: Red (red-50, red-600, red-800)

## Security Considerations

1. **Payment Verification**: All payments are verified with TossPayments API
2. **Amount Validation**: Payment amounts are validated against database records
3. **Coupon Validation**: Coupons are validated server-side
4. **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can access the plans page

## Testing

To test the payment flow:

1. Navigate to `/plans`
2. Select a plan
3. Enter a test coupon (TEST20 or SAVE5000)
4. Click "Confirm Payment"
5. Use TossPayments test card numbers for testing
